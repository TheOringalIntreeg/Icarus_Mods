How To Update these .pak Mods Manually


Remove the old version entirely...
- Opening the Icarus Mod Manager (IMM).
- Click the "Remove All Mods from Game" button in the bottom right column.
- In the Extracted Mods column on the left, right click the old "Mike's Overhaul".
- Click "Delete Mod"

Install the new version...
- On the top right column of IMM, click "Extract Mod from PAK File.
- Navigate to the .pak file in the Mike's Overhaul directory.
- Click on the .pak file.
- Click Open.
- Wait for the text output at the bottom of IMM to read "Extraction complete!"
- Double click on "Mike's Overhaul.pak", in the left column and any other mods you want to install. ***Note: Any mods that target D_ProcessorRecipes.json will likely cause a glitch.*** (My favorites are More Reources, 2XP, and Donovan's More Points from the IMM Download Mods menu)
- Click "Install All Listed Mods" in the column titled "Mods to Install:".
- Wait for the "IMM_Merged_Mod was Created" message in the IMM text output.
- Close IMM.
- Enjoy.
